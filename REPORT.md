Abstract:
Chess which do play between two players on a board is intellectual and
mental game, it has its own rules of play which help to enhance and im-
prove the mental and intellectual activities of the player, and this game
has a huge amount of players around the all world they have strongly
interested to have play it. This document deals with the fully computer-
ized Chess Game, _rst, the game computerizes for two player to do play
chess according all the valid rules of the chess on computer. Secondly,for
making the game more interesting that will make users to direct do play
against computer, computer intellectual force is added.
Introduction:
Chess is a game for two players, dubbed White and Black. The goal is to
capture your opponent's king. In the game, this is known as a checkmate.Chess
is played on a board with 64 squares. Each player begins with 16 pieces, lined
up in two rows. The _rst row is occupied by pieces called pawns. The next
row contains: a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and two knights.
Chess is de_ned as a game of \perfect information", because both players
are aware of the entire state of the game world at all times: just by looking
at the board, you can see which pieces are alive and where they are located.
Checkers, Go, Go-Moku,Backgammon and Othello are other members of the
category, but stud poker is not (you don't know what cards your opponent is
holding in his hands).
Here that to able to change chess game from physical form to _gurative form
fully realistic, Several things are needed to make chess game computerized and
intelligent.
Literature review:
For making computerized chess game, which will let two players to play chess
game in computer realistic. We need two things which we must introduce to
computer.
_ Some way to represent a chess board in memory, so that it knows what
the state of the game is.
_ Rules to determine how to generate legal moves, so that it can play
without cheating (and verify that its human opponent is not trying to
pull a fast one on it !).
First we should introduce chess board and its elements to computer, next we
need to produce movement for chess pieces according to rule if chess game.


Proposed methodology:
This code is in python where we have implemented the method of A* method and also a method named as heuristic which returns the manhattan distance that is the difference of a grid from present location to its desired location in goal state and a method named as moves which returns the set of all possible moves in a scenario
To a computer, it is far from obvious which of many legal moves are "good"
and which are "bad". The best way to discriminate between the two is to look
at their consequences (i.e., search series of moves, say 4 for each side and look
at the results.) And to make sure that we make as few mistakes as possible,
we will assume that the opponent is just as good as we are. This is the basic
principle underlying the minimax search algorithm, which is at the root of all
chess programs.
Unfortunately, minimax' complexity is O(bn), where b ("branching factor")
is the number of legal moves available on average at any given time and n (the
depth) is the number of "plies" you look ahead, where one ply is one move
by one side. This number grows impossibly fast, so a considerable amount of
work has been done to develop algorithms that minimize the e_ort expended
on search for a given depth. Iterative-deepening Alphabeta, NegaScout and
MTD(f) are among the most successful of these algorithms, we will discuses
with more detail later in this document.
Another major source of headaches for chess programmers is the "horizon
e_ect", _rst described by Hans Berliner. Suppose that your program searches
to a depth of 8-ply, and that it discovers to its horror that the opponent will
capture its queen at ply 6. Left to its own devices, the program will then
proceed to throw its bishops to the wolves so that it will delay the queen
capture to ply 10, which it can't see because its search ends at ply 8. From the
program's point of view, the queen is "saved", because the capture is no longer
visible... But it has lost a bishop, and the queen capture reappears during the
next move's search. It turns out that _nding a position where a program can
reason correctly about the relative strength of the forces in presence is not a
trivial task at all, and that searching every line of play to the same depth is
tantamount to suicide. Numerous techniques have been developed to defeat
the horizon e_ect.
Result and discussion:       
 

 

Conclusion:
This project was really helpful in building up the ability to think critically about the algorithm which we used in the project and also that time can be saved by implementing algorithms for solving problems rather than solving it manually, however building  this code required certain perquisites like possible moves in the given scenario, rules for solving the Chess etc. The scope of artificial intelligence is very large in todayâ€™s era where machines are taking over difficult jobs and thereby increasing the productivity.
